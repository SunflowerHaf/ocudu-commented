// Generic network gateway interfaces: sctp_network_gateway (for control-plane connections), udp_network_gateway (for user-plane), io_broker (non-blocking I/O event dispatch), network_gateway_config types, and the timer-driven reconnection framework.
//
// This file defines abstract interfaces / data types used across multiple
// layers. Implementations live in the corresponding lib/ directory.
