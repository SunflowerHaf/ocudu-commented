// INTERFACE HEADER — include/ocudu/phy
// Physical layer interface headers (~233 files): the largest include tree. Contains: upper_phy_rx_symbol_handler and upper_phy_rg_gateway (the DL/UL boundary between upper and lower PHY), resource_grid (the frequency-domain IQ sample grid), channel processor interfaces (PDSCH, PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, SRS processors), DFT interface, channel estimation interfaces, LDPC encoder/decoder interfaces, rate-matcher interfaces, modulator/demodulator interfaces, and all the supporting data types (resource_element_mapping, re_buffer, modulation_scheme, etc.).
//
// This file defines abstract interfaces / data types used across multiple
// layers. Implementations live in the corresponding lib/ directory.
